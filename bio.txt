My background in Music Technology and the Business of Entertainment (NYU) bridges the creative and logistical sides of sound. Iâ€™ve worked on dozens of original compositions, including for New York Fashion Week, interactive scores for indie games, and helping with custom pitches at Tuner Music for global brands.
